## Escape Sequences

Escape sequences are sequences of characters which don't represent themselves when used inside a string literal / character, typically used to provide literal representations of non-printing characters and characters that would otherwise have a special meaning, e.g. double quotation marks (").

| Escape Sequence | Represents        |
| :-------------: | :---------------- |
|       \0        | Null              |
|       \n        | New Line          |
|       \t        | Tab (Horizontal)  |
|       \v        | Tab (Vertical)    |
|       \\'       | Single Quote      |
|       \\"       | Double Quote      |
|       \\\       | Backslash         |
|       \\?       | Question Mark     |
|       \b        | Backspace         |
|       \a        | Alarm (Beep/Bell) |
|       \r        | Carriage Return   |
